calculator
==========

Attempt at making a calculator application in Ruby. 

I am trying to play around with Ruby and see if I can make a Calculator. This is my first "app" and it is a good way for me to learn how Ruby works. I know that I am probably not using the best practices and my code probably looks really bad but I am just trying to learn.

If you have any questions or ways I can improve this app please let me know. Thank you.
